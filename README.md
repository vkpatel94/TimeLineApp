# MiniTimeline
This project was generated with Angular.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##Requirements 
All the basic requirements cards, buttons are implemented in this app. 
When "Submit Log" button is clicked new log card is added below in the list. 
Each card contains a title, a message and a formatted date (in built DatePipe is used to achieve this).

##Bonus Requirements
Implemented a conformation modal when delete button is clicked. It has "Yes/Cancel" buttons, and deletes the selected log when pressing "Yes". 
Also I have added two small features from my side as mentioaned below:

1. You can change card's color as per your need. For now there are only five colors in list, in future which can be extended by implementing a color picker.

2. Also I have added a search feature using which you can search for specific log in the list. For now you can "search by title", in future which can be extended by adding more options like search by date, search by range of dates etc.
